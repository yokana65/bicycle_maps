## Loading the data

At this point the package expects a shapefile for administrative boundaries. This data can be found
with local or national authorities or on specialized websites like https://www.diva-gis.org/.

 The Shapefile has to be stored under `data/`in the project directory and needs to contain a column with
 a geometry, the administrative level of interest (for example districts) and a unique identifier for the 
 administrative units of interest.

 Additionally the CRS of the final map needs to be specified. The default value is WGS84.


```{r examples-load_spatial_data}
data <- load_spatial_data(name = "VG250_KRS", column = "SN_L", filter_by = NULL, crs = 25832)

head(data)
```

```{r examples-geocode_locations}
data_geocode <- geocode_locations(locations = c("Leipzig", "Lützen", "Weißenfels", "Naumburg", "Bad Kösen", "bad Sulza", "Auerstedt"), crs = 25832)

head(data_geocode)
```
